            <h2>Moat: Native Cross-Chain Architecture</h2>
            <div class="indent">
                <p>Yusan's moat lets you open shorts or longs on BTC directly from BTC mainnet. You just need to send your BTC to your own BTC address, deposit in the pool, and click to loop for a long. No need for bridges, wrapped assets, or risking MEV sniping.</p>
                
                <p>Yusan leverages chain-key cryptography for secure cross-chain orchestration. Through signing transactions and sending them around, we achieve:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>One unified pool instead of multiple fragmented ones across many chains</li>
                    <li>CEX experience: Dedicated address per chain (ETH, Bitcoin, ICP)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Powered by our bridging smart contracts leveraging:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Threshold ECDSA</strong>: Sign BTC/EVM transactions in a decentralized fashion, no single node has the key</li>
                    <li><strong>Bitcoin light node</strong>: Every ICP node runs a Bitcoin light node, direct BTC data no intermediaries</li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP outcalls</strong>: Reach RPC through consensus</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Compared to perps, Yusan offers lower fees, easier UX, and built-in yield for your BTC from people going long or short. We can assume more risk than traditional lending thanks to our unique liquidation strategy.</p>

            <h2>Protocol Design</h2>
            <div class="indent">
                <h3>Pool-based Lending</h3>
                <p>Yusan is built on a pool-based lending system, the same as those that power top money markets like Compound or AAVE.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lending/Borrowing</strong>: In pool-based lending, users supply one or multiple assets to earn yield. Once deposited, those assets can also act as collateral to borrow from other pools. Interest rates on a user's loans are set by pool utilization—the fewer assets in the borrow pool, the higher the interest users pay. As rates increase, demand drops, diminishing rates and incentivizing new borrowing, creating a balanced system.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Core Risk Management</strong>: Yusan sets risk parameters on each asset. The health factor H<sub>f</sub> computes the safety of all a user's deposited assets. A health factor above 1 is a healthy position; below 1, some positions become eligible for liquidations. This is an essential step to prevent bad debt and ensure the protocol remains solvent.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="300" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/3282730/5495202"></iframe>
                </div>

                <h3>Yusan Liquidation Pools: A Generalized, MEV-Resistant Liquidation Engine</h3>
                <p>Once the health factor of a user drops below 1, their position needs to be liquidated to maintain protocol solvency. To incentivize repayment of the debt, protocols typically offer a 5-10% discount on the collateral.</p>
                
                <p>The battle to get this discount is usually won by sophisticated players, MEV bots, which race to be the first to liquidate users and claim the liquidation bonus. With an average fee of 5% on AAVE v3, this means $3,600,000,000 USD × 5% = <strong>$180,000,000</strong> going to the MEV bots instead of the users of the protocol.</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/1955184/3227781?Time+interval_e15077=month&Trading+Num+Days_n26d66=360"></iframe>
                </div>

                <h3>Current Flawed Solutions</h3>
                
                <h4>AAVE with SVR</h4>
                <p>AAVE uses Chainlink's SVR (Smart Value Recapture) to "recapture" liquidation bonuses. The approach currently recaptures between 25-75% of the liquidations, which is highly inefficient. Even when it recaptures the underlying liquidations, AAVE only benefits from a small amount of the liquidation bonus, and AAVE users see none of this.</p>
                
                <img src="public/images/svr-recapture.png" alt="SVR Recapture" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">
                <img src="public/images/liquidation-bonus-split.png" alt="Liquidation Bonus Split" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">

                <h4>Liquity Stability Pool</h4>
                <p>Liquity liquidations are simple; a stability pool liquidates a user by repaying their debt and distributing the collateral and its bonus pro-rata to the pool. This prevents a single MEV bot from sniping all the rewards.</p>
                
                <p>However, it comes with its own flaws:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Liquity is a CDP and not a money market, so it only works between their stablecoin and the three collaterals they allow</li>
                    <li>Relies on external parties that get compensated to call the permissionless liquidations functions</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Yusan Solution: Generalized and Automated Liquidations Engine</h3>
                <p>Yusan takes the strong points of both models while fixing their flaws, thus creating the first truly efficient liquidation engine for money markets.</p>
                
                <p>First, <strong>we generalized Liquity's Stability pool into our own called Liquidation Pool</strong>. When a user gets liquidated, the liquidation pool provides the capital to repay the debt. The collateral and the liquidation bonus are then distributed pro-rata to the pool. All of the value is fully captured and goes right back to the protocol.</p>
                
                <p>Second, <strong>no need for external parties</strong>, the liquidation events are automatically processed once a position reaches LTV. No more missing out by leveraging ICP's timers—Yusan initiates the liquidations by itself.</p>

                <h4>Liquidation pools offer two distinct advantages:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>100% capture</strong>: All the liquidation bonuses are redistributed to the pool, and not to MEV or partially to the protocol like in SVR's case.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced security</strong>: The protocol at any point knows how much price drops it can handle; we don't rely on off-chain capital willing to liquidate users' positions when the market swings.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Added bonus</strong>: The liquidation pools allow users to set intents. You can stack yield with whatever you wish. Deposit USDC, stack in BTC.</p>

            <h2>Growth Flywheels</h2>
            <div class="indent">
                <p>Our growth strategy is to deliver yield on products with no prior yield in iterative steps, building one on top of the other, creating liquidity and meeting users' needs at every step of the way.</p>

                <h3>USDC Yield</h3>
                <p>In leading protocols like AAVE, stablecoins represent half of the borrows and a third of the deposits. The demand for stablecoins comes from borrowers seeking liquidity against their volatile assets. This demand is currently not being met on ICP.</p>
                
                <p>On Ethereum, against the base asset of the chain (WETH), we can see 90% of the borrows putting WETH as collateral are for stablecoins.</p>
                
                <img src="public/images/WETH-borrow-against.png" alt="WETH Borrow Against" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">
                
                <p>The same can be seen for yield-bearing assets like wstETH, where stablecoins account for 40% of the borrows:</p>
                
                <img src="public/images/wstETH-borrow-against.png" alt="wstETH Borrow Against" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">
                
                <p>Meeting this demand would push USDC/USDT yield to around 5%. The chain currently lacks a money market, leaving users with no solutions for sustainable and safe stablecoin yield.</p>

                <h3>ICP Yield</h3>
                <p>The next pressure is the demand for going long on ICP by people taking leverage. Part of the yield would be from users seeking liquidity, the other part from users looping for leverage. You will be able to achieve a 5x ICP exposure by depositing ICP, borrowing USDC, buying more ICP, and so on.</p>
                
                <img src="public/images/leverage-icp.png" alt="ICP Leverage" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">
                
                <p>You can take even larger leverage by using nICP as collateral. Given nICP yield is around 14%, if ICP goes sideways, the yield of nICP would pay off the debt it accrues.</p>

                <h3>BTC Leverage</h3>
                <p>With the deep partnership with OneSec (same team), we can offer a BTC-focused product once we have enough stablecoin TVL, allowing people from BTC to loop and take longs on their BTC.</p>
                
                <img src="public/images/WBTC-borrow-against.png" alt="WBTC Borrow Against" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">
                
                <p>Users get their own BTC address, to which they can deposit BTC and then use on the platform. Facilitating with a BTC address lets us address a deeper market.</p>

                <h3>Smart-Yield</h3>
                <p>Yusan smart-yield will balance your collateral between the liquidation pool and the lending pool. The liquidation pool should have good APY per below:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/5596737/9105012"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>Most liquidations are stablecoins:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/4692692/7804620?Trading+Num+Days_n26d66=360"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>But they liquidate WETH (reinforcing the demand to be liquid on the main asset of the network):</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/4692685/7804615?Trading+Num+Days_n26d66=360"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>This mechanism allows us to take more risks on the platform as liquidations are done automatically and we tap into the full TVL rather than relying on off-chain MEV.</p>

            <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
            <div class="indent">
                <p>Every successful DeFi ecosystem is built on top of a few primitives: a liquid staking, a stablecoin, a decentralized exchange (DEX), and a money market. When combined, these primitives create a flywheel of liquidity and growth.</p>
                
                <p>Until now, ICP has been missing the money-market piece. In the last year there has been the launch of a solid liquid staking and bridged stablecoin. We are now only missing a money market to unlock the full potential of DeFi on the IC. Yusan is that money market.</p>
                
                <img src="public/images/wheel.png" alt="DeFi Wheel" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">

                <h3>Quantifying the TAM</h3>
                <p>On every other chain that has all those primitives, lending is ~25% of the chain's TVL:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="600" height="380" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQpjcaAiuZav0Ah2mKW6Vz5gpQWawVAmOVtpu4T46FTSTm5a713lvsRc3uKiG5vUgyuVcW6e0icE4j8/pubchart?oid=1783534872&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>Currently the TVL of ICP is $32M, introducing a lending protocol could grow the ecosystem's total value to <strong>$11M in new TVL</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Most of the deposits would come from a few classes of assets. If we compare with the industry leader on Ethereum, AAVE's deposits are as follows:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/3214653/5374461"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>Grouped per category:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/5590469/9096229"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>Which gives us roughly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/3rd is stablecoins</li>
                    <li>1/3rd is liquid staking derivatives</li>
                    <li>1/3rd is base tokens (WETH) and BTC</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Now if we look at what people borrow:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/3214653/5374465"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p>Now if we break this down again, stablecoins represent half of the borrowed amount, and WETH more than a third.</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <iframe width="900" height="350" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://dune.com/embeds/5590798/9096351"></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>It's roughly 50% stablecoins and 40% WETH. The high amount of WETH might be surprising; however, it points to sophisticated users looping liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) to maximize their yield exposure. The stablecoin borrows are either to maximize leverage or simply going long while being liquid.</p>
